# gnibbler - Crypto Finance Fullstack - Don't take a bite, start with a Nibble

# Introduction
This application seeks to pull data from Messari.io in order to present a website that collects, aggregates, and collates blockchain entity data.

Once organized the site intends to index, sort and present the information in new and interesting ways that allow for the evaluation of the entities based upon some form of standardized framework.

Once evaluated this data will be used to create a smart contract infrastructure that enables decentralized investment into the underlying entities using the developed analytical model above.
